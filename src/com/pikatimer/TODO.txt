Setup wave starts (assigned by bib for now, AG/Other later) with a minimum of 1 per race
Setup wave <-> participant map
Setup AG's
Setup split locations
Split -> timing location map
Map segments to split locations (distance, min/max times, display rate: m/s, m/h, k/h, s/100y, s/100m) 
Setup start waves
Metadata for split locations (distance, min time, max time, cutoffs, estimated % of total time)
Optional alternate date for the race, otherwise inherit the event date. (? Multi-Day relay races?)

Participants:
DONE -- Delete a row/rows via a context menu
DONE -- Select which columns to show (bib, first, last, age, city, race, etc)

DONE -- import from csv
Clean up import from csv 
DONE (I hope) --  Fix deadlock with mass write/delete
export to csv
Validate csv file before continuing. 
Error check the fields (age, city, state, bib, etc). 
Wave(Race) Assignment 
Automatic Wave (Race) Assignment based on bib #
Update/Add on enter from any valid field
Custom fields / attributes w/ data types (string, limited select, date, time)
Link to Team
Link to Relay Team
Inline Edit of the cells?
Mass bib assignment 
sync from active.com / runsignup / other

Relay Teams? Figure this one out!
? Relay team attribute set to the team name or team id?
? Same as regular teams? 


Timing:
Setup bib -> chip map
import times from file with min/max times
Auto detect gun times based on triggers in input files and assign to the race/wave
Auto-assign time to split based on time vs other splits (and % time for that wave vs the finish time). 
Continually import times from file (tail in a separate task) to a timing point
Continually import times from box (via tcp in a separate task) to a timing point
