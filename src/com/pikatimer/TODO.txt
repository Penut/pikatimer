Overall Focus: 
Create a DurationTextField / LocalTimeTextField that "does the right thing"
Create a DurationCell (or whatever) for inline edits of durations?
-DQ flag + reason for a participant
-Fix Result object to calculate and keep split Properties that are based on the start time
-Wrap result object in a Platform.runLater to avoid all sorts of issues with the extractor
-Fix result display to show wave start -> actual delta, gun time
-Fix result display to disassemble the old SortedList -> FilteredList -> List stuff 
to avoid AOOBE in sorted List on split changes
-Backup times flag
-Ignore Chip Read flag (ignoring a cooked time is easy, propagating that to the raw is a bit harder)
-Mandatory split? (if it is mandatory, bail if no data found)
-Force participant to the 1st wave of a given race if they are seen at a given timing 
location? (Good for start lines and really remote locations, but it could be trouble for post run spectators.)



Overall:
DONE: Upgrade H2 
Upgrade Hibernate to 5.x
Fix FXML layout resizing checks on race page
Add License Key enforcement? 
Add 'About' page w/ links to the following items:
--gliphicons
--h2 db
--hibernate
--AlphanumericComparator 
--flyaway
--DataFX
--ControlsFX 

Logging 
  --no more System.out.println
  --switch to log4j or something else
  --enable debug output log viewing
  --enable saving debug output log to file
  --enable toggle to set debug level to Normal/Debug/Trace
Internationalization? (Spanish, English, French, German, British, US, etc)



Races:
Default start time to 8am? 
Don't permit blank start time.
Don't permit blank wave start times / default to race start time or 1st wave start time

 - Pull from downstream awards checkbox. 
Metadata for split locations (distance, min time, max time, cutoffs, estimated % of total time)
Ability to set min/max times for a segment
Ability to drag/drop splits to reorder

Ability to Flag a race as a relay race

Participants:
  -- limit to one wave or multiple per checkbox on the event setup

  -- textfield auto complete for city/state 
  -- textfield for teams pre-populated / with auto complete
Clean up import from csv (field formatting, etc)
Export to csv
Validate csv file before continuing. 
Error check the fields (age, city, state, bib, etc).

Wave/Race assignment based on import field
Update/Add on enter from any valid field
Custom fields / attributes w/ data types (string, limited select, date, time)
Link to Team
Inline Edit of the cells?
Mass bib assignment 
Show race/wave as column
Used first/last name edit fields as filters for the list
Flag bib if already in use, disable "add" option, only edit
sync from/to fusesport / active.com / runsignup / other

Relay Teams? Figure this one out!
? Relay team attribute set to the team name or team id?
? Same as regular teams? 
Auto-determine relay team category based on participants (male, female, coed, etc)?
Allow team to cover multiple categories? (female + coed?)
Allow team to cover multiple races?
Min for score attribute?
Team category setup (gender, mixed gender, custom data field setting, etc)

Timing:
Add intermediate dialog for bib -> chip setup
  -- show # of mappings
  -- clear option
Ignore chip reads times option

Overrides 
  -- Make the bib an autocomplete text field based on the runners
  -- replace if bib + split already exists
  -- cleanup split drop down for when the runner is in multiple races


Backup Times option
  -- keep processing if found, overwrite if a non-backup time is found. 

Clear all times for the timing location input when the user selects a new reader
Clear all times for a location when the location is deleted
Backup flag for a given reader at a split

Option to assign any time to the race/wave start time via right mouse click


Search dropdown to show only a single timing location in the TableView


RFID Direct:
    --Continually import times from box (via tcp in a separate task) to a timing point
    --Rewind option for times read from box/outreach
    --Chip sequence gap detection that triggers an automatic rewind 


Done: (for now) fix column widths


Results:

     --Auto-assign time to split based on time vs other splits (and % time for that wave vs the finish time). 
Wire in a "min time to next split" option to replace hardcoded 10 minutes. 
cleanup the spacing on the tableview, wider names.
