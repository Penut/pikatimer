Internationalization? (Spanish, English, French, German, British, US, etc)


Races:
DONE -- Add Races
DONE -- If only one race, race name = event name (hide the race name)
DONE -- Specify Distance for race
DONE -- Specify an optional cutoff time for the race
DONE -- Calculate the pace needed to make the cutoff 
DONE -- Setup wave starts (assigned by bib for now, AG/Other later) with a minimum of 1 per race
DONE -- Setup wave <-> participant map
DONE -- Setup split locations
DONE -- Split -> timing location map
DONE -- Setup start waves
DONE -- Update split distance units when main race unit is updated
Setup AG's
Setup Award Depth 
Metadata for split locations (distance, min time, max time, cutoffs, estimated % of total time)
Ability to set min/max speeds for a segment
Ability to drag/drop splits
protect start/finish split from removal
auto-update finish split distance
allow for zero distance splits (transition)
Ability to Flag as a relay race
Cumulative vs differential distance for splits specification?
Ability to override the pace display for a segment: m/s, m/h, k/h, s/100y, s/100m) 
Ability to set split specific distance unit
Ability to create segment "groups" (swim, bike, run)? 
Optional alternate date for the race, otherwise inherit the event date. (? Multi-Day relay races?)
Prevent removal of waves that have assigned participants
Prevent removal of races that have assigned participants
Prevent removal of Timing Locations that are mapped to splits (or cascade)
Prevent removal of start/finish split
Auto-update finish split distance/cutoff
Show bib range if there are multiple races and wave starts is not checked

Participants:
Switch wave attribute mapping to a "getWaveByID" type of system to avoid hibernate fetching hell
DONE -- Delete a row/rows via a context menu
DONE -- Select which columns to show (bib, first, last, age, city, race, etc)
DONE -- Alphanumeric sort of the bib numbers 
DONE -- Edit an existing entry
DONE -- Migrate to SimpleStringProperties for better TableView updates
DONE -- Set focus to the first field after adding/modifying an entry
DONE -- double click to edit a row
DONE -- swap bibs menu option if two and only two rows are selected
DONE -- Move the participantsList management into the ParticipantDAO
DONE -- import from csv
DONE -- ability to assign the runner to a wave of one or more races
DONE (I hope) --  Fix deadlock with mass write/delete
Middle Name/Initial
Clean up import from csv (field formatting, etc)
export to csv
Validate csv file before continuing. 
Error check the fields (age, city, state, bib, etc). 
DONE -- Wave(Race) Assignment 
DONE -- Automatic Wave (Race) Assignment based on bib #
Wave/Race assignment based on import field
Update/Add on enter from any valid field
Custom fields / attributes w/ data types (string, limited select, date, time)
Link to Team
Link to Relay Team? (or do we just set "Relay Team Race" as  a race attribute?)
Inline Edit of the cells?
Mass bib assignment 
Show race/wave as column
Only store wave id and then programatically do the linking rather than letting hibernate mess it up
sync from/to fusesport / active.com / runsignup / other

Relay Teams? Figure this one out!
? Relay team attribute set to the team name or team id?
? Same as regular teams? 
Auto-determine relay team category based on participants (male, female, coed, etc)
Allow team to cover multiple categories? (female + coed?)
Team category setup (gender, mixed gender, custom data field setting, etc)

Timing:
Setup bib -> chip map

Raw vs cooked tables. 
        -- import to raw and place in queue
        -- run any time shifts, cuts, chip -> bib map
        -- then insert into cooked and place into results queue
        -- reprocess raw if parameters for the timing location change
            -- time shift
            -- bib -> chip
            -- min/max times
Clear All Option
Clear all times for a given timing location Option
Clear all times for a given timing location reader option
Backup only flag for a given reader at a split
DONE: Multiple readers per timing location
DONE: Import times from file
Discard duplicates
If Start, Auto detect gun times based on triggers in input files and assign to the race/wave

DONE: Continually import times from file (tail in a separate task) to a timing point
Continually import times from box (via tcp in a separate task) to a timing point
Rewind option for times read from box/outreach
Chip sequence gap detection that triggers an automatic rewind for direct reads

Time shift (+/- a fixed offset to adjust for clock errors on the timing box) 

Show most recent data read for a reader / timing location
Search data read for a reader / timing location



Results:
Read from "cooked" tables queue; 
    --process, place into results tables, shift/mask other results as warranted
    --Auto-assign time to split based on time vs other splits (and % time for that wave vs the finish time). 
Show results in filterable / sortable view

Publish to responsive / html 5 based web site

Team Results
Male, Female, Coed, user selected variable (city, state, custom, etc)
scoring numbers per team (1->N)
for co-ed, number per team of each gender (1->(N-1))


Awards: 
Set depth per race
Set depth based on # registrants / finishers
Team based on top X scorers (specified per team category)
Award Depth options: Fixed depth, variable, top X % with a cap
Ordered list (overall, masters, AG) with per group option to pull winners from
downstream awards. (double dipping yes, no, maybe)
