Races:
DONE -- Add Races
DONE -- If only one race, race name = event name (hide the race name)
DONE -- Specify Distance for race
DONE -- Specify an optional cutoff time for the race
DONE -- Calculate the pace needed to make the cutoff 
DONE -- Setup wave starts (assigned by bib for now, AG/Other later) with a minimum of 1 per race
DONE -- Setup wave <-> participant map
DONE -- Setup split locations
DONE -- Split -> timing location map
DONE -- Setup start waves
Setup AG's
Setup Award Depth 
Metadata for split locations (distance, min time, max time, cutoffs, estimated % of total time)
Ability to set min/max speeds for a segment
Ability to drag/drop splits
protect start/finish split from removal
auto-update finish split distance
allow for zero distance splits (transition)
Ability to Flag as a relay race
Cumulative vs differential distance for splits specification?
Ability to override the pace display for a segment: m/s, m/h, k/h, s/100y, s/100m) 
Ability to create segment "groups" (swim, bike, run)? 
Optional alternate date for the race, otherwise inherit the event date. (? Multi-Day relay races?)
Prevent removal of wages that have assigned participants
Prevent removal of races that have assigned participants
Prevent removal of Timing Locations that are mapped to splits
Prevent removal of start/finish split
Auto-update finish split distance/cutoff

Participants:
DONE -- Delete a row/rows via a context menu
DONE -- Select which columns to show (bib, first, last, age, city, race, etc)
DONE -- Alphanumeric sort of the bib numbers 
DONE -- Edit an existing entry
DONE -- Migrate to SimpleStringProperties for better TableView updates
DONE -- Set focus to the first field after adding/modifying an entry
DONE -- double click to edit a row
DONE -- swap bibs menu option if two and only two rows are selected
DONE -- Move the participantsList management into the ParticipantDAO
DONE -- import from csv
DONE -- ability to assign the runner to a wave of one or more races
DONE (I hope) --  Fix deadlock with mass write/delete
Clean up import from csv (field formatting, etc)
export to csv
Validate csv file before continuing. 
Error check the fields (age, city, state, bib, etc). 
DONE -- Wave(Race) Assignment 
DONE -- Automatic Wave (Race) Assignment based on bib #
Wave/Race assignment based on import field
Update/Add on enter from any valid field
Custom fields / attributes w/ data types (string, limited select, date, time)
Link to Team
Link to Relay Team
Inline Edit of the cells?
Mass bib assignment 
Show race/wave as column
sync from active.com / runsignup / other

Relay Teams? Figure this one out!
? Relay team attribute set to the team name or team id?
? Same as regular teams? 


Timing:
Setup bib -> chip map
import times from file with min/max times
Auto detect gun times based on triggers in input files and assign to the race/wave
Auto-assign time to split based on time vs other splits (and % time for that wave vs the finish time). 
Continually import times from file (tail in a separate task) to a timing point
Continually import times from box (via tcp in a separate task) to a timing point
Time shift (+/- a fixed offset to adjust for clock errors on the timing box)
